# Services : Cluster IP

You will create a Cluster IP service and access it.

## Create a Deployment

Here is the deployment file:
```sh
cat << EOF > deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-deployment
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: metrics
      department: sales
  replicas: 3
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: metrics
        department: sales
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: hello
        image: "gcr.io/google-samples/hello-app:2.0"
EOF
```

```sh
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

## Create a Cluster IP service

Here is the service file:
```sh
cat << EOF > service.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-cip-service
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  selector:
    app: metrics
    department: ingeneering
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 8080
EOF
```

```sh
kubectl apply -f service.yaml
```

Ensure the service has entries in its endpoints... if not, correct the `service.yaml` because it may be incorrect!

To see the endpoints:
```sh
kubectl describe svc my-cip-service
```

## Test the service connectivity

Determine the CLUSTER IP
```sh
kubectl get service my-cip-service -o wide
```

Access the service: try the [CLUSTER_IP]:80. This does not work. Why? How can you access the service?

Execute a shell inside a pod of the service:
```sh
kubectl exec -it  my-deployment-7bc95fb476-q75rz /bin/sh
# Install curl
apk add --no-cache curl
```

Try the curl on http://my-cip-service.default.svc.cluster.local:80

## Clean all resources

```sh
kubectl  delete -f .
```
